      "Space Rocks is an Asteroids homage written in vanilla JS. It was written as an exercise for learning TDD in a      javascript environment, and to explore how a game engine works in a browser. No node packages where used for     the game itself, though many where employed to enable the writing of tests, and for 'compiling' the code      from multiple module files into a single JS file. ",
      "The game engine is a simple loop based on setInterval. The main loop calls a series of 'subsystems' that in      turn handle things like player input, collision detection, moving entities (asteroids), and trigger audio      and visual FX. Communication is an event-driven system to allow for loose coupling between the different Subsystems."
